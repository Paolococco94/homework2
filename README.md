In the exercise a Gazebo world is recreated that replicates a part of the computer science department of the University of Verona.
Using the Turtlebot3 (virtual) robot, a map of the department is created and saved.
The video shows the data displayed by Rviz when the robot is sent, with the 2D Nav Goal command, in a position of the virtual world.
